Arquero to the rescue.\nArquero! Now what is that? Observable JavaScript is its own coding language and we can minimize the learning curve by keeping our data wrangling within our favorite coding language. Then we can focus on using the {Plot} grammar and syntax, which is quite similar to {ggplot2} – see the above example. However, Observable JS is a complete and rich coding language of its own. But just like {shiny}, we want to learn just enough to get the job done. Still, there’s always an edge case where a little data wrangling is optimal. This is where {arquero} comes in. Arquero is used for data transformation and is easy to learn because it was inspired by {dplyr}. Show the code for the first plot on this page and you’ll see the similarity to {dplyr}.\nBelow I parse a data type using {arquero}.\n\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\nmy_data_wrangled = my_data\n  .derive({  date: d =>  op.parse_date(d.date) })\n```"
