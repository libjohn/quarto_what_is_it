<div class="gray">
<p><strong>Derive date</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the <code>{dplyr}</code> wrangling that I did in the background of this code notebook, I still needed to parse the date fields. Arquero to the rescue.</p>
<p><strong>Arquero</strong>! Now what is that? <em>Observable JavaScript</em> is its own coding language and we can minimize the learning curve by keeping our data wrangling within our favorite coding language. <strong>Then</strong> we can focus on using the <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot">{Plot}</a> grammar and syntax, which is quite similar to <code>{ggplot2}</code> – see the above example. However, <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/">Observable JS</a> is a complete and rich coding language of its own. But just like <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/">{<code>shiny</code>}</a>, we want to learn just enough to get the job done. Still, there’s always an edge case where a little data wrangling is optimal. This is where <a href="https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/introducing-arquero"><code>{arquero}</code></a> comes in. Arquero is used for data transformation and is easy to learn because it was inspired by <code>{dplyr}</code>. <em>Show the code</em> for the first plot on this page and you’ll see the similarity to <code>{dplyr}</code>.</p>
<p>Below I parse a data type using <code>{arquero}</code>.</p>

<p>By convention, observable libraries are loaded at the bottom of a code notebook. You can read more about observablejs at Observablehq.com. By way of a teaser, I didn’t have to use <code>{r}</code> to wrangle the retail data. I could have <em>imported the data directly from observable</em>. Such as ….</p>
<p>&gt; <code>import { data, advancedDate } from "@observablehq/monthly-retail-trade-report-data"</code></p>
<p>But on this page, I’m demonstrating how we leveraged <code>{R}</code> and <code>{ojs}</code> code with Quarto, so that I can present useful interactivity and demonstrate multi-lingual coding using a Quarto notebook.</p>

<span id="cb9-195"><a href="#cb9-195" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="vs">**Arquero**! Now what is that? *Observable JavaScript* is its own coding language and we can minimize the learning curve by keeping our data wrangling within our favorite coding language. **Then** we can focus on using the [{Plot}](https://observablehq.com/plot) grammar and syntax, which is quite similar to `</span>{ggplot2}<span class="vs">` -- see the above example. However, [Observable JS](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/) is a complete and rich coding language of its own. But just like [{`</span><span class="fu">shiny</span><span class="vs">`}](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/), we want to learn just enough to get the job done. Still, there's always an edge case where a little data wrangling is optimal. This is where [`</span>{arquero}<span class="vs">`](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/introducing-arquero) comes in. Arquero is used for data transformation and is easy to learn because it was inspired by `</span>{dplyr}<span class="vs">`. *Show the code* for the first plot on this page and you'll see the similarity to `</span>{dplyr}<span class="vs">`.</span></span>
