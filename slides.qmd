# Define

## Quarto

-   Open-source publishing system

-   Leveraged by multiple coding languages (Python, R, Julia, ObservableJS)

-   Supported by multiple IDEs (VS Code, Jupyter, RStudio, Neovim)

-   Can [publish](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) to multiple hosting targets (QuartoPub \| GitHub Pages \| Posit Connect \| Netlify \| Others)

## Notable

Everything I'm going to show you was coded with open-source tools and published via Quarto

## Tidyverse

I'm going to use RStudio and freely publish to Quarto.pub

-   Quarto further develops the workflow of **reproducible** computation by extending *markdown* and literate coding **workflows**

> In much the same way that **Tidyverse** brings consistency and good documentation to base-R, and **Tidymodels** brings consistency and good documentation to modeling and ML, **Quarto** brings consistency and good documentation to reproducibility (i.e. \[literate\] coding.)

## Reproducibility Payoff

Reproducible workflows for *computation thinking*

data → analysis → publishing

-   Do everything with code

-   Derive reports from code

Quarto reports can be PDF, MSWord, Slides (PPTx, revealjs, etc.), Websites, Dashboards, eBooks, Blogs, Interactivity apps (ObservableJS; Shiny; more)

## Citations, Tables, Figures, and Scientific Notation

-   Quarto will generate citations and a bibliography in multiple styles

    -   Can integrate with DOI/Zotero/.bib/.bibtex/Endnote ...

-   Quarto generates numbering for tables and figures

-   Excellent support for LaTeX equations and citations

## Review

Quarto helps you derive reports from code and facilitates publishing to your favorite host

. . .

#### Note:

Unlike many other tools, Quarto is open, does not lock-in to a proprietary host. You render Quarto reports that can be hosted anywhere, anytime. Quarto is about scholarly \[scientific\] communication.
